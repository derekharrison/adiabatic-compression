# AdiabaticCompression
Adiabatic compression simulation. There are two scripts available for performing the simulation. One in matlab and one in python. Also, a python script is added for generating an mp4 of a given simulation. The script requires an executable ffmpeg.exe, which can be obtained at https://ffmpeg.org/.
